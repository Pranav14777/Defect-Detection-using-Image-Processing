# Defect-Detection-using-Image-Processing
Utilized Resnet50 and EfficientNetB7 CNN pretrained models to classify Metal casting images as defective or non defective.Employed a unique approach by considering a paucity of samples for training and using abundant portion of the dataset for testing.The model showed a exemplary performance by producing an accuracy of 96 percent.
